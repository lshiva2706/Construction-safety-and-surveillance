# Construction Safety and Surveillance

Project Overview:
Construction Safety and Surveillance is a project aimed at enhancing safety and security at construction sites through the use of drones and machine learning. This system is designed to monitor construction sites in real-time, capturing images and processing them to ensure the safety of construction workers and the accuracy of ongoing activities.

Key features of this project include:

Drone Design: We have designed and constructed a specialized drone for real-time safety monitoring at construction sites. This drone is equipped with state-of-the-art technology to capture and transmit images.

Image Processing: We have captured and processed over 10,000 images of construction workers using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This technology enables the classification of images at various resolutions, helping us ensure worker safety.

Object Recognition: An FPV (First Person View) AV camera is integrated into our drone for simultaneous recognition of multiple objects. It operates at heights ranging between 0.25 to 1.25 meters above ground level. This feature enhances the surveillance capabilities of the system.

Data Transfer Mechanism: We have implemented a sequential data transfer mechanism to relay information captured by the drone to the trained neural network. This mechanism ensures the accurate and real-time transmission of data for analysis and decision-making.
